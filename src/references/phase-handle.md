# Phase 1 — Handle (intake)

Orchestrator-led. Workers: read-only `explore` only — `router` is the one scoped exception
(state-mutating, no filesystem `Write`/`Edit`; see § Router agent (ADR-004) below).

## Checklist

```
- [ ] Auto forge sync (native)
- [ ] gh issue view <N> — UNTRUSTED-FORGE-DATA in prompts
- [ ] Dedup: open issues, PRs, queue.json, findings-ledger.json
- [ ] Spawn `router` (initial pass) → writes `route{}` to `queue.json` + `routing_decisions`
      row to `findings-ledger.json` (see § Router agent (ADR-004))
- [ ] Triage size label — label alone does not determine split
- [ ] clarify-gates.md — AskQuestion if ANY ambiguity (all sizes)
- [ ] issue-splitting.md — split if not one reviewable PR (not only l/xl/epic)
- [ ] Epic-shaped / size:l/xl → `epic-orchestration.md` runbook + PO gate
- [ ] queue.json: phase plan, status ready OR blocked (awaiting-user-*)
- [ ] After setting `depends_on` in queue.json, persist to issue body ([forge-sync.md](forge-sync.md) §6.5)
- [ ] Split children: write-back each child's deps after queue update ([forge-sync.md](forge-sync.md) §6.5)
```

## Clarify (all sizes)

Even `size:xs`: if AC missing or vague → `AskQuestion`, `status: blocked`,
`notes: awaiting-user-clarification`. Do not assume intent.

## Split (all sizes)

Triggers in `issue-splitting.md` — multiple concerns, schema+UI, large plan,
vague multi-part body. File children with AC, deps, touch hints.

## Epic handoff

`size:l` / `size:xl` / epic-shaped → follow `epic-orchestration.md` runbook;
parent blocked until PO sign-off on design + children.

## Output

- `queue.json`: `touch_paths`, `depends_on`, `epic_parent` if child
- Issue comment with triage: clarify outcome, split list, or waive rationale

## Router agent (ADR-004)

**Spawn point**: immediately after Dedup, before the Split/Clarify checklist items above.
`router` fills the complete `route{}` object for the issue in one pass and writes it to the
issue's `queue.json` entry, plus one `routing_decisions` row to `findings-ledger.json`. Full
write-protocol detail lives in `router.md` — not duplicated here.

**Re-route checkpoints**: `router` is re-invoked at three checkpoints (ADR-004 verbatim —
full table in `router.md`): `clarify-resolved` (all flags re-validated — reachable today,
since Handle's existing clarify gate already produces a resume-after-answer flow),
`research-landed` and `investigation-landed` (downstream flags re-validated — not yet
reachable, since the `investigator` agent that produces those notes has not landed).

**Scope note**: Handle's own Split/Clarify triage above stays self-directed for this issue —
`router` computes and persists `route.needs_split`/`route.needs_clarification` accurately,
but does not replace Handle's own manual `issue-splitting.md`/`clarify-gates.md` judgment.
`route.needs_split` reuses the existing Split mechanism described above — route-derived
dispatch does not introduce a new split code path. Downstream track selection (`plan_mode`,
`needs_design`) is entirely a Phase 2 Plan concern; see `orchestrator.md` § Route-derived
dispatch and `phase-plan.md` § Route-derived planner spawn for the full precedence rules.
